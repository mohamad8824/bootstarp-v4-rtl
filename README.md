## Documentation

Bootstrap's documentation, included in this repo in the root directory, is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and publicly hosted on GitHub Pages at <https://getbootstrap.com/>. The docs may also be run locally.

Documentation search is powered by [Algolia's DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/).

### Running documentation locally

1. Run `npm install` to install the Node.js dependencies, including Hugo (the site builder).
2. Run `npm run test` (or a specific npm script) to rebuild distributed CSS and JavaScript files, as well as our docs assets.
3. From the root `/bootstrap` directory, run `npm run docs-serve` in the command line.
4. Open `http://localhost:9001/` in your browser, and voilà.

Learn more about using Hugo by reading its [documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/).

### Documentation for previous releases

You can find all our previous releases docs on <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/versions/>.

[Previous releases](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases) and their documentation are also available for download.
